### Hello World! ðŸ‘‹

I'm yet another 4th-year undergraduate student studying Computer Science.

Currently *trying* to explore Deep Learning and its applications in the fields of Quantitative Finance and Health Care. I'm looking to gain some research experience in these fields.

With some previous internship experience in Software Engineering, I consider myself as a washed-up developer but nonetheless, I keep keen interests in Full Stack Web Development, DevOps, and sometimes dabble in competitive programming and at most times not foray into the fields of Cloud Computing and Big Data.
